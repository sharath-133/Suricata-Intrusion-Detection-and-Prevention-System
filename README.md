# Suricata Intrusion Detection and Prevention System

## Objective
The objective of this project is to implement Suricata as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) to perform real-time network traffic analysis and threat detection. By optimizing rulesets, capturing network traffic, and integrating with a SIEM system, this project aims to enhance the organization's security posture through effective threat identification and incident response.

### Skills Learned
- Suricata Configuration: Implemented and optimized Suricata for real-time monitoring and threat detection in network traffic.
- Ruleset Management: Configured and fine-tuned rulesets to improve detection accuracy and minimize false positives.
- Network Traffic Analysis: Conducted detailed traffic captures and analysis using Wireshark for deeper insights into network behavior.
- SIEM Integration: Integrated Suricata with a SIEM system for centralized log management and streamlined incident response processes.
- Custom Rule Development: Developed tailored detection rules to identify and mitigate advanced persistent threats (APTs).
- Alert Monitoring: Monitored and analyzed alerts generated by Suricata to enhance security strategies and response capabilities.

### Tools Used
- Suricata: The primary intrusion detection and prevention system for network analysis.
- Wireshark: For capturing and analyzing network traffic data.
- SIEM System: For centralized log management and incident response (specify which SIEM if applicable).
- Custom Rules: Developed using Suricata’s rule syntax for threat detection and mitigation.


# Installing Suricata IDS on Ubuntu Server

1. Install Suricata on the Ubuntu endpoint. We tested this process with version 6.0.8 and it can take some time:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oisf/suricata-stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install suricata -y
```

2. Download and extract the Emerging Threats Suricata ruleset:
```
cd /tmp/ && curl -LO https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata-6.0.8/emerging.rules.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvzf emerging.rules.tar.gz && sudo mv rules/*.rules /etc/suricata/rules/
sudo chmod 640 /etc/suricata/rules/*.rules
```

3. Modify Suricata settings in the /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml file and set the following variables:
```JavaScript
HOME_NET: "<UBUNTU_IP>"
EXTERNAL_NET: "any"

default-rule-path: /etc/suricata/rules
rule-files:
- "*.rules"

# Global stats configuration
stats:
enabled: Yes

# Linux high speed capture support
af-packet:
  - interface: eth0
```

4. Restart the Suricata service:
```
sudo systemctl restart suricata
```
